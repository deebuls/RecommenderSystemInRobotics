\section{Discussed}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Deebul Presented his Detailed Project Plan for winter semester 2014. The Project Plan was discussed.
		\item Professor commented not to use the specific case of Recommender Systems. But to Generalize the idea of Recommender System (i.e. to completely understand the science behind the Recommender systems) and view the problem as a general Machine learning problem. Such that the Recommender System becomes 1 of the application of the generalized Machine learning.
	\item Open Questions : What is the outcome of the project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Approved Activities}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Report was accepted with some suggestions. 
	\item Reduce the number of experiments suggested to 1.
	\item Increace the evaluation parameters regarding the experiment
	\item Rnd has to work more on the the topics "Why Recommender system works in the learning specifically Robotics"
\end{itemize}

\section{Next Meeting}
To be decided.
