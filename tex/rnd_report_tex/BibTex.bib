	abstract = {Abstract— Learning from demonstrations is an intuitive way
for instructing robots by non-experts. One challenge in learning
from demonstrations is to infer what to imitate, especially when
the robot only observes the teacher and does not have further
knowledge about the demonstrated actions. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to the problem of inferring what
to imitate to successfully reproduce a manipulation action
based on a small number of demonstrations. Our method em-
ploys techniques from recommender systems to include expert
knowledge. It models the demonstrated actions probabilistically
and formulates the problem of inferring what to imitate via
model selection. We select an appropriate model for the action
each time the robot has to reproduce it given a new starting
condition. We evaluate our approach using data acquired with
a PR2 robot and demonstrate that our method achieves high
success rates in different scenarios.},

and highly specialized to the datasets from which they are derived, making them
difficult to transfer between tasks. While multi-task learning and domain adaption
techniques address some of these problems on a theoretical level, from a practical
standpoint they are just as complicated and labor-intensive as the simpler learning
techniques they supplant.
However, suppose that these specialized classifiers had simply been collected
into a library: while it is unlikely that any specific classifier would generalize well to
a new dataset, there may exist some classifier in the library that is tuned to the same
conditions as the new task. This thesis addresses the fundamental question of how
to efficiently select a good classifier from such a library.
Specifically, this thesis demonstrates that collaborative filtering techniques (such
as employed by recommender systems like Netflix and Amazon.com) can be used
to recommend models appropriate for a specific target task. These recommendations
are made by trying, or rating, a small subset of models on the target task, and then
using that small set of ratings along with the ratings of the models on other tasks to
predict the ratings of the unevaluated models on the target task.
This process, which we term “model recommendation”, is applied to action
recognition and other vision and robotics applications, and the subtle differences
between model recommendation and typical recommender systems are used to de-
rive novel algorithms and extensions to the core recommendation concept.},
