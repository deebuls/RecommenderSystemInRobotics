	abstract = {Abstractâ€” Learning from demonstrations is an intuitive way
for instructing robots by non-experts. One challenge in learning
from demonstrations is to infer what to imitate, especially when
the robot only observes the teacher and does not have further
knowledge about the demonstrated actions. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to the problem of inferring what
to imitate to successfully reproduce a manipulation action
based on a small number of demonstrations. Our method em-
ploys techniques from recommender systems to include expert
knowledge. It models the demonstrated actions probabilistically
and formulates the problem of inferring what to imitate via
model selection. We select an appropriate model for the action
each time the robot has to reproduce it given a new starting
condition. We evaluate our approach using data acquired with
a PR2 robot and demonstrate that our method achieves high
success rates in different scenarios.},
